<a name="receptor_v1-Receptor"></a>

### Receptor
Receptor service, or a Trustero client application, collects findings supporting the use of services from a
service provider account.  For example, AWS is a service provider, AWS account is a service provider account,
and S3 is a service.  Trustero associates collected evidence to business controls in support of the business&#39;
stated procedures.  Evidences are organized into a finding.  Each evidence is associated with a service entity
and contains the service&#39;s configuration information. For example, an AWS S3 bucket and its configuration.

| Method Name | Request Type | Response Type | Description |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------|
| Verified | [Credential](#receptor_v1-Credential) | [.google.protobuf.Empty](#google-protobuf-Empty) | Verified reports whether the provided credential is a valid service provider credential for purpose of discovering service entities and reporting findings. This rpc call is typically made as callback by a receptor to Trustero from a check-credential receptor request. |
| GetConfiguration | [ReceptorOID](#receptor_v1-ReceptorOID) | [ReceptorConfiguration](#receptor_v1-ReceptorConfiguration) | GetConfiguration for the receptor and service provider credential using the provided receptor object identifier. This rpc call is typically made as a callback by a receptor prior to making a report findings or discover service entities receptor request. |
| Discovered | [ServiceEntities](#receptor_v1-ServiceEntities) | [.google.protobuf.StringValue](#google-protobuf-StringValue) | Discovered reports known service entities. A receptor or a Trustero client application reports its known service entities on request. A service entity is a configurable asset of a service such as an S3 bucket. This call returns a string value discovery ID or an error. |
| Report | [Finding](#receptor_v1-Finding) | [.google.protobuf.StringValue](#google-protobuf-StringValue) | Report a finding to Trustero. A receptor or a Trustero client application reports its findings to Trustero on a periodic basis. This call returns a string value collection ID or an error. |
| Notify | [JobResult](#receptor_v1-JobResult) | [.google.protobuf.Empty](#google-protobuf-Empty) | Notify Trustero a long running report finding or discover service entities receptor-request has completed. JobResult contains information about the receptor-request and it&#39;s corresponding result. |
| SetConfiguration | [ReceptorConfiguration](#receptor_v1-ReceptorConfiguration) | [.google.protobuf.Empty](#google-protobuf-Empty) | SetConfiguration reports the configuration for receptors that need extra configuration to access a service. This call is typically made as a callback by a receptor after credential verification. |
| StreamReport | [ReportChunk](#receptor_v1-ReportChunk) stream | [ReportResponse](#receptor_v1-ReportResponse) | StreamReport is used to stream large reports to Trustero. The report is sent in chunks and the first chunk contains the boundary with the mime type. |
